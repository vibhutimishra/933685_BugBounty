# DSC Bug Bounty - FrontEnd Track

## Important Instructions

1. Don't assume anything. If you have a doubt, feel free to reach out to any of the DSC organizing team members.
2. Points will be awarded based on how <b>close</b> you were able to get the buggy frontend to look like how we want it to.
3. Individual bug fixes carry their own points.
4. Don't delete or rename any of the files in the folders.
5. You can modify the contents of the files as much as you like, but remember, the final submission of the website must look identical to the one we've shown. You will find links to GIF's/Video's of the non-buggy working website in the individual folders.
6. You can begin with any project, and complete them in any order you like.

## Submission guidelines

1. Please download zip of this repository or use `git clone` if you're well versed with git. (at your own risk, you may have to delete the `.git` folder before committing again). Please reach out to us if you face any issues.
2. Make a private repository on github under any one of your accounts and keep making commits (or upload files) on a regular basis. This may be used to <b>resolve ties</b> later on.
3. Please don't change the folder structure under any circumstance. This will only make the evaluation of your code harder for us.
4. Any submissions/commits post the deadline will result in a strict disqualification of your team.
