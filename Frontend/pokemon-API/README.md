# Pokemon API

## Introduction
Tony set out to display a list of Pokemons. However, there are some problems with his code, making it buggy. Can you help him fix them? 

## What does this project do?
It fetches list of 18 pokemons from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co) and displays them on front-end once the user clicks ``Generate Pokemon``. You can hover over individual cards to view the stats of the pokemon.

Once all the pokemons are generated you can delete all the pokemons by clicking on ``Delete`` button and ``Generate Pokemon`` reappears functioning as it was before.
